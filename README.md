# 🌌 Aether 3D

**Aether 3D** is an immersive, data-driven visualization experience built with **React**, **React Three Fiber**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
It transforms abstract data into a dynamic 3D environment where metrics become living visual entities that evolve in real time.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **React + TypeScript** — Frontend framework and type safety  
- **React Three Fiber (Three.js)** — Declarative 3D rendering  
- **Zustand** — Lightweight global state management  
- **Leva** — Interactive control panel for live configuration  
- **TailwindCSS v4** — Utility-first styling with Vite integration  
- **Framer Motion** — Smooth animations and transitions  

---

## 🧠 Project Goal
Aether 3D aims to merge **data visualization**, **artistic expression**, and **real-time interaction**.  
Users can add metrics, manipulate visual entities, and watch the 3D environment adapt to the state of their systems.

## 🧩 Development Phases
1. **Core 3D Environment** – Scene, camera, and rendering setup  
2. **Entity Engine** – Dynamic data-driven objects  
3. **User Controls** – Configuration and persistence  
4. **Environmental Intelligence** – Scene reactions and audio feedback  
5. **Optimization & Deployment** – Performance tuning and CI/CD
